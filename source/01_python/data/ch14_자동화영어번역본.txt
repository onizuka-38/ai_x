"When does a person stop?" It is not when the heart stops, nor when the breath is cut off. "The real death is when people are completely forgotten in their memories." This word left by Dr. Hiruk in the cartoon dress pierces the essence of life beyond fiction.,Many people think of a good life as a long life, a lot of money, and social success, but this question asks again where the true value of life lies: Does it live in someone's mind after we're gone?,Was our existence worth remembering?
Dr. Hiruk was a doctor, but he wanted to mend his mind more than he wanted to get ill. He repeated his ridiculous experiments, and as a result he was ridiculed and despised, but there was a firm belief in hope. ","Spring is coming to this country!" His desire to smoke cherry blossoms in a country where cherry blossoms do not bloom was not just a medicine, but a life of planting warmth in people's hearts.,He could not cure the disease, but he left a person who could be warm to a being called Choppa, and the spirit continues to breathe afterwards.
What is a good life? Is it a life of great achievement? Or is it a life of quiet obedience to one's work? Iru Luke says: Remembering is the good life.,Every word, attitude, and action we have left remains like a seed in someone's heart, and if it blooms someday, it is a life that does not die forever. A warm word to people, sincere consideration, reckless but pure dream.,These things eventually make life shine. "A good life is not a life compared to others, but a life that has left a positive mark on someone's life.
"A man dies, but his spirit remains." As long as his spirit is hope and courage to another, we never die.
